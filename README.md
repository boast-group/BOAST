# BOAST

The BOAST (BOLD Optimisation for Acquisition Sensitivity Tool) toolbox for SPM helps optimizing echo planar imaging (EPI) protocols for maximal BOLD sensitivity, particularly, where affected by susceptibility artifacts.

Optimal use of and settings of z-shim, gradient polarity and slice tilt can significantly increase the BOLD sensitivity. Since the method is based on numerical simulations it does not require expensive measurements like previous approaches. This also improves its flexibility and automation.

The approach and its applications are described in detail in the open access publication by Volz et al. ([Neuroimage 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.12.052)).
